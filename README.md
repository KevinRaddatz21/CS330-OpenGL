**How do I approach designing software?**
When I am designing software, I break things down into as small of pieces as I possibly can. I try not to look at it as one big problem, but instead a number of smaller problems. It tends to go a lot smoother and quicker this way. 
**How do I approach developing programs?**
While Working on my 3D scene for this project, I attempted to follow along with as much course material as possible and model my work off of what I was learning. This was tough as programming typically comes natural to me, but graphics programming has been an entirely different animal. Breaking this project down into milestones was incredibly helpful as it allowed me to go piece by piece through the code. 
**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computational graphics and visualization gives me a lot of new C++ skills that I didnt have before. I also have gained a new way of looking at 3D scened and breaking them down into 2D and primitive shapes. These will all help me when searching for a career in the future as a developer.
